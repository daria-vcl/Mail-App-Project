# Mail-App-Project

This is a **C++**, **OOP-centred project** for my University course - _"Principles of Object-Oriented Programming"_. The purpose of the project was creating a C++ application which fulfills certain Obect-Oriented Programming principles/requirements. 
The requirements of the project were:
- to create at least **4 classes**, which should be used for the application's purpose;
- to use **at least one vector, one set, one list and one map** from the Standard Template Library to manage the application's data;
- to create a console menu, in which the user can choose different options (e.g. reading a new object from the keyboard, or other application-specific functionalities): the menu would be a **Singleton class**;
- to use at least one **Template class**;
- to use at least 2 **Template methods**;
- to have treated any possible exception which could appear the execution of the code (**the code has to throw at least 6 exceptions**, 3 of them having to be of a different type);
- to exemplify the concepts of **upcasting** and **downcasting**;
- to exemply the concepts of **multiple inheritance** through an inheritance of type Parent-Child-Grandchild;
- to make sure each class contains:
  - the constructor with all parameters;
  - the constructor without parameters;
  - the copy constructor;
  - the overloading of =;
  - the overloading of >>;
  - the overloading of <<;
  - the destructor;
